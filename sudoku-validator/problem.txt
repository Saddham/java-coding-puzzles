You are given a simplified 3x3 Sudoku board filled with numbers
(Please see Word and XML files attached).

Check all numbers manually and figure out which once are invalid (if any).

Write a program that reads the XML input and validates all numbers.
Each invalid number and its location should be printed in the output.

Your program should run in this format:

java myprogram
Validating Sudoku grid
Found following invalid numbers:
1. Row 1 Column 2 Value 7
n. ...

Modify the original XML and create new file with correct numbers.

Run your program again. Your program should run differently:

java myprogram
Validating Sudoku grid
Sudoku grid is valid

Some notes:

•	You must solve the problem using Java code.
•	You are encouraged to make use of any of the standard classes provided by the Java SDK.
•	The test data is in the directory called test in your home directory.

Good luck!
