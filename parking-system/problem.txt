You are a consultant who has been hired to write some software for a company that runs parking garages. After a brief initial discussion with the client, all you know is that they want a system that will provide insight into the state of all their garages in real time -- how many vehicles are currently in the garages, the breakdown of cars and trucks (because they pay different rates), where they are in the garages, how much money they’ve made today… As you leave the meeting, just for fun you take a moment to sketch out a very quick diagram showing hierarchy and relationships for some of the major classes in the system you’ve started imagining, based on the small amount very high-level info you have.

Draw that hierarchy. Remember, this is a brain dump on a napkin in a hall – it doesn’t have to be (in fact, it can’t be) perfect, extensive, or complete.
